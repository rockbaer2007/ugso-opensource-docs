# Home Assistant Card Editor

The **ATLAS Home Assistant Card Editor** is the first visible reference
application in the ATLAS environment. It is used to design Home Assistant cards
visually, import existing YAML cards and prepare exportable card packages or
HACS-oriented bundles.

The local demo uses:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:4174/
```

Connection settings are managed through Atlas Administration:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:4175/
```

## Modes

The editor separates two workflows.

| Mode | Purpose |
|---|---|
| Simple | fast card generation from selected entities and layouts |
| Expert | free editor surface with a 12-column grid, drag and drop, resizing and container cards |

Simple mode focuses on entity selection, card target, layout and YAML preview.
Expert mode places cards from the left card list on a Home-Assistant-like grid
surface.

## Home Assistant Connection

The Card Editor can receive a Home Assistant URL and access token from Atlas
Administration. The token is not written permanently into the editor; it is only
used as a session handoff.

The editor currently supports:

- connection through the Home Assistant WebSocket API
- loading entities through `get_states`
- local cache for entities and entity domains
- synchronization status below the connection state
- search and filtering by domain, name or entity ID
- Lovelace resource checks through the browser WebSocket and Admin WebSocket proxy

The resource debug panel can be enabled through `Show resource debug`. It shows
whether the browser WebSocket, the Admin WebSocket proxy or a fallback is stuck.

## Card List

The Expert card list contains Core cards and detected Community cards. It can
show local templates, known HACS resources and scan-only resources.

Supported base cards include:

- Entity
- Entities
- Overview / Glance
- Button
- Grid
- Sensor
- Vertical stack
- Horizontal stack
- Thermostat
- Link
- Webpage
- Mushroom Template
- Bubble Card
- Tabbed Card V2

Scan-only entries are registered Lovelace resources for which ATLAS does not yet
know a safe card mapping. They are shown for inspection but are not treated as
fully configurable cards automatically.

## Container Cards

Expert mode supports container cards for:

- `vertical-stack`
- `horizontal-stack`
- `custom:tabbed-card-v2`

Cards can be placed into these containers through drag and drop. Tabbed Card V2
manages tabs and the cards contained in each tab. Stack cards keep their
contained cards as separate elements and show them as a text list in the info
box.

## Import

The editor can import Home Assistant card configurations from:

- YAML files
- YAML from the clipboard
- JSON
- ATLAS Card Packages
- HACS bundles with embedded `atlas/*.atlas-card.json`

During import, ATLAS detects `card_mod` and `uix` styles. Entity styles are
assigned to the matching entities; global styles remain visible as their own
style block. The original YAML should stay as close as possible to the imported
source and only change when the user edits the card.

## Export

The editor can create several artifact types:

- Home Assistant YAML
- Expert HA card YAML
- Card script
- Card package
- HACS-oriented bundle
- resource list

When exporting an HA card, users can choose whether styles are written as
`card_mod` or `uix`. Export filenames receive a Windows-style counter when a
name already exists.

## Tabbed Card V2

Tabbed Card V2 is handled as its own ATLAS card and exports as:

```yaml
type: custom:tabbed-card-v2
```

Expected resource:

```text
/hacsfiles/tabbed-card-v2/tabbed-card-v2.js
```

The editor notes that Tabbed Card V2 is its own card. It is inspired by the
original `kinghat/tabbed-card`, but maintained as a separate ATLAS variant.

## Current Status

The Card Editor is in active development. Simple and Expert mode, import/export,
entity selection, resource checks and container cards are already testable.
Additional custom-card mappings from scanned HACS resources will be added step
by step.
